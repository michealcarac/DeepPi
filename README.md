# DeepPi
Speech Recognition and Image Recognition Deep Learning on Raspberry Pi Zero W

Please read [InitialSetup](https://github.com/michealcarac/DeepPi/blob/main/InitialSetup.md) first if haven't already 

## Getting Started
For this project, you will need a few things
1. A computer to install some programs on
2. A internet connection
3. Either two Raspberry Pi's, one normal and one Zero W, or you can simply plug in a keyboard, mouse, and monitor to the Zero W and set up it's SSH/VNC that way

The following programs that will be used
1. Keras
2. Docker
3. Jypter Notebook
4. Google Colab (Optional to Jypter Notebook if you don't want to train locally)
5. Tensorflow
6. OpenCV

Now, only some of these programs will be on your computer/raspberry pi respectfully.

Computer:
1. Keras
2. Docker
3. Jypter or Colab
4. Tensorflow

Raspberry Pi:
1. Tensorflow
2. OpenCV
